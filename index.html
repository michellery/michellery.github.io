        <div class="post-content">
          <p>Not that long ago, I remember starting my foray into 
          coding and programming...</p>
          <p>I started out with some fun coding games which barely 
          scratched any kind of surface. Then, moved on to learning 
          some HTML and CSS for creating and updating a secure 
          web site in the Marine Corps. Later, I would take a 
          Coursera course in Statistics that taught a great deal
          of R. Once I was in school for my current program; 
           though, I moved on to SPSS - but I won't have <em>that</em> resource forever!</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>I think I would like to be a vet...or a singer
          ...or a spy...or even better... <strong> Indiana Jones</strong>!!</p>
          <p>I love learning about places around the world, cultures,
          languages, symbols, and why people do what they do. I also
          love to read. History is my favorite subject.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>If somebody would have told me
          a week ago that I would be able to
          make a web site without a significant amount of help (like Wix, etc.), 
          I would <strong> not </strong> have
          believed them.</p>
          <p>Just a few days later, I remembered an application
          called Mimo and started to work
          on a <em> real blog</em>. What was the motivation? 
          ...either procrastination or the curiosity inspired by friendship.</p>
          <p>Maybe both</p>
